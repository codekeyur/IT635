# IT635
Database Administration Projects
If you go into the IT635 repository you will find two seperate dir name Midterm Project and patientapp. Both of these is contain an application project but the content and approached in implementation the app is diiferent.
# Midterm Project :
 Here designed app using php, postgres, html and css, so its kinda traditional web app by implimenting front-end and back-end technologies.
# patientapp :
Here the concept or the end-result is the same but as I am using the postgresql as a my back-end platform so I wanted to integrate python with my db so there is really great
tool and perhaps the most popular PostgreSQL adapter called psycopg2 that i have used here.
